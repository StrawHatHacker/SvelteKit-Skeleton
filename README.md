This is an **opinionated boiletplate skeleton** for a new SvelteKit project.

Out of the box you get **TypeScript**, **SCSS**, **Tailwind** support, **node-adapter** for SSR builds, basic **authentication example** and working **tests**.

## Gotchas

##### Why are headings not selectable?

##### Why are SVGs the wrong color?

##### Why is progress element not positioned correctly?

##### Where can I change the reduced motion options?

All can be fixed by editing `src/styles/sanitize.scss`. Or you can delete it!
