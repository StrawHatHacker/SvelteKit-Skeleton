This is an **opinionated boiletplate skeleton** for a new SvelteKit project.

Out of the box you get TS support, SCSS support and node-adapter preinstalled for SSR builds.

## Todo

Check if the package works in production

## Gotchas

##### Is heading not selectable?

##### Are SVGs the wrong color?

##### Progress element not positioned correctly?

##### Want to change the reduced motion options?

    Fix it in styles/sanitize.scss.
